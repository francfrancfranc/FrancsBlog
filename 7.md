### 23/06/2024| DOTOS 1: On Geriatricians 

> For a recent Troika project, I threw together a seed for a dungeon in a dragon's belly. I came up with the Dungeon of The Obtunded Sabre, built by the Royal Order of Geriatricians. These names came at random because they rolled off my tongue, but they quickly grew into a concept for a 5-level dungeon for The Vanilla Game. Below is a rumination on why a Royal Order of Geriatricians is actually a perfectly sensible setting for a traditional megadungeon.

The geriatrician is a symptom of a society that has begun to eat itself. Such a society is not only blessed with the *boon* of sufficient technology and surplus resources to care for the elderly. It is also cursed by the *bane* of a rising elderly population and falling birth rate.

As this problem worsens, the incentive for solutions becomes ever greater. The geriatrician climbs in wealth and status. Royal titles and prized relics are bestowed to notable practitioners. Funding and legal workarounds are provided for laboratories dedicated to the science of anti-aging.

The intensive security of geriatric care-and-research campuses also makes them well-suited as maximum-security prisons and treasure vaults. It is not long before high-value individuals and objects are moved into the care of the Geriatricians.

The first real breakthroughs come in the realm of care. The legal doors to necromancy are blown wide open in order to provide cheap workers in care facilities. Non-euclidean spaces are developed to house mind-bogglingly large geriatric wards.

But the problem is not *solved*. More and more people are surviving to ever-greater ages. Eventually, the geriatric arts -- and with them, the majority of a civilisation's human and material resources -- are devoted entirely to one end: The Geriatrician's Stone, a theoretical construct that would reverse age itself. 

Human sacrifices are made. Boroughs are flattened to make space for element- refineries.
The unveiling of the Stone is the event of the millennium -- the very last hope of a civilisation about to buckle under its own weight.

But it does not work. The Stone, it turns out, only works on one person at a time. It was incalculably expensive; there will be no second Stone. Additionally, the Stone's operation forms a lethal byproduct. Anti-Ambrosia; age itself distilled into a lethal contact-poison. It will never leave the hands of the ruling class. 

Riots, famine; another empire falls. 

Left behind, somewhere in the tangled ruins (or a dragon's belly), is the Royal Order of Geriatricians: Fabled hiding-place of the key to eternal life. Filled with undead carers, forgotten prisoners, and strange treasures, all waiting, patiently, to be uncovered, remembered once more.
