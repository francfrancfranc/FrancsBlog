### Swyvers Alternate Combat
Swyvers is a game about Victorian bastard criminals pulling heists.

*HP*. Starting HP is 3d6, so between 3 and 18 with an average of 10 or 11.

*Street fighting.* It should be pretty brutal. Could go either way on an even playing field. But when is it ever? Ambushes, surprise attacks, or negotiation should be preferred.

*I just watched Dune.* Hand to hand combat should be full of feints and tricks, aiming to set up for a single killing blow.
Simplicity. It’s not really a fighting game. A scrap shouldn’t last half the session.

*Dice.* Just cubes please.
**Initiative**
Begin with surprise actions, followed by Troika chit-pull. In short: Players get two chits. GM gets chits per enemy as per stat blocks (e.g. Dog 3, Geezer 2, Elephant 1), to a max of 8. There’s an end of round chit. Pull at random. When the end of round is pulled, all chits go back in to the bag.

When you pull your chit, have the option of holding onto it until another party member pulls theirs, for team moves.
**Dice**

Fight: opposed 2D6+skill. Highest wins. Loser takes the difference as damage to HP.

Maneuver: Spend an action to remove the ability to retaliate. Likely to require a skill test, but if the idea is smart, consider that a successful INT test. Make the test opposed if it makes sense to do so. Once done, put your chit back in the pile. On success, the target does not oppose the next attack against them. Maneuver skills are specific. Instead of Grapple +3, you have Leg Sweep +1 and Headlock +2.

NPC Maneuver: Doesn’t work the same. It doesn’t remove the opposed roll, it just inflicts (low) flat damage on success. Normal enemies shouldn’t be doing as many maneuvers. For VIPs, maneuvers do extra stuff like AoE damage or altering the combat environment. 

Social combat: Rhetorical jockeying. Only usable against enemies that can communicate and can be coerced, confused, denigrated, or bargained with. Opposed 2D6+skill, loser takes the damage. Damage is taken to enemies’ Morale, players’ HP. Can’t Kill or Maim; falling to 0hp from social combat represents a crippling insult or psychologically injurious rhetoric.

Range: A surprise shot, against a slow or still target, out of initiative, hits — 2d6 damage. In combat, opposed 2D6+skill. If enemy loses, they take the difference as damage. If the enemy wins, pull a random chit and then put it back— the arrows hits that person, and they take the difference as damage. 

**Armour**

Shields and armour are temp HP. It breaks. 3 levels: Ropey(1), decent(2), or mint(3). 

Weapon quality is damage reduction. 3 levels: Ropey(0), decent(-1), mint(-2).
