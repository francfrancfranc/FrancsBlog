### 22/05/2024 | The Menagerie 2: How to Sail and Sink a Star-Going Vessel
> These rules, designed for *Troika!*, are about 300 words and fit cleanly on two A5 pages with 1 inch margins. I'm quite happy with them. Ship's Luck, in particular, feels very tonally apt, and elegantly fills in many rules gaps. Much like it does for PCs in the game's core rules!
#### Create the Star-Vessel
1. Determine how many hit dice(HD) the ship has.   
2. In addition to Main, Engine, and Orlop, the ship has [HD] other decks.
3. The ship has 4 Initiative. For each HD over 2, it has 1 less initiative (minimum 1).
4. The ship starts with armour dice(AD) equal to HD.
5. Roll HD. The ship starts with that much Luck.
6. Draw the ship\* and name it.   
\*or Google an old TSR spelljammer.
##### Suggested Decks
**Main**: Open to elements. Need suit.  
**Orrery**: +1 to Astrology test per Ship's Luck spent.  
**Passenger/Cargo**: Charge freight or passage: [HD]*100p per journey. Opens up lucrative trade/smuggling.  
**Quarterdeck**: Officers' quarters. Players: pimp it out.  
**Lower**: Crew quarters and utility storage. Test Ship's Luck to have useful equippage.  
**Engine**: Steam, pipes, vents, twisting passages.  
**Orlop**: Frigid canyon dark and deep where hull slices sky. â…™ of monster infestation per journey.  
#### Sail
**Astrology**: Nominate an astrologer. Test to arrive at intended location + know **what's nearby**:  
|D3 | Object | Aspect | Scene |
|--|--------|--------|-------
|1| Colony | Organic | Under attack  |
|2| Other vessel | Precious resource | Smuggler's haven |
|3| Space Dungeon | Non-euclidean | Travelling circus |

**Golden Barge Pilot**: Nominate a pilot. Test to hide from/escape hazards.  
**Fuel**: Test Ship's Luck after a journey. Fail: Need fuel.  
**Rest**: 1 day in safe harbour restores 1D3 Luck, 1 AD.  
**Repair**: Nominate an engineer. Test Craft(Golden Barge) to limp home. Otherwise, you'll have to hitchhike.  
#### Fight
**Fire guns**: Nominate Gunners. Attacker rolls HD, defender rolls AD. Add Gunners' Skill+Adv. Skill. High HD knocks out low AD. When enemy is out of AD, auto-hit.  
###### *Example: A(2HD) attacks, rolls 2,3. B(2HD) rolls 1, 6. Loses 1AD.* 
**Ship's Luck**: At 0 AD, test per hit. Fail: Ship immobile.  
**Fire guns (alt)**: Gunner throws a 1D3 into target receptacle. Hit: Observe die; target loses that many AD.
