# 03/05/2024 | The Menagerie 1: Happenings and Rumours The Night Before Witch-Con

>*Each Menagerie Pamphlet will do three things: 
>1. Invigorate and celebrate 5 creatures from the fabulous Troika! Bestiary chapter.
>2. Provide an interactive adventuring location with squabbling factions and queer loot.
>3. Add a little mechanic to your game.  
>Pamphlet 1 is about Witch-Con. Inspired loosely by Roald Dahl.*
## 6 Happenings At Midnight

1. A squall ripped through at sundown, cobbles clean and slick. You could hear a pin drop. A beautiful woman, slaked with blood, clutching a razorblade, drags herself along silently, gagged by a flung CHAIN OF MURDERING\*. A PARCHMENT WITCH, slashed and sopping, pads after her.
2. A rhinoceros -- no, a horrifically bloated NIGHT PIG, wanders out from behind a jewellers'. Burps coins, poops a ruby. 
3. A HARPY wings out of a high window like a shot bird, a wailing babe in each talon. Mum, face wet, grim. Reloads wordlessly.
4. A drunk is dying. Mouth open, stomach full of coiling eels. *Second sight:* SEPARATOR perched on head. Barbed tongue snakes down his neck, gorges on viscera.
5. ORC GROOM in a smoking tux, beside himself. Best man consoling. Desperate to be sent back to his wedding by the young Witch who summoned him, but kicked out of the CONVENTION CENTRE and can't get back in.
6. Huge delicious pie stumbles on four legs. Inside: Two children gasp that there's WITCHES in the CONVENTION CENTRE, swear revenge.

\* Fine silver chain, fishhooks on either end. Test Bola Fighting to throw; mutes target. Test Dehooking to remove.

## 6 Talks of the Town
1. The CONVENTION CENTRE is being used. Curtains drawn by day. Blazing light and cackles at night. House with chicken feet perches on roof.
2. People wake up sick, missing kidneys, spleens, livers.
3. A gang of children chucked a woman with webbed feet and five metres of hair into the river.
4. Patrons of cafes within a mile radius are finding frogspawn in their coffee.
5. Local sheet-beater delivered a pie tin 2 yards across to the CONVENTION CENTRE.
6. There's a CONVENTION for the EVILLEST WITCHES IN THE UNIVERSE tomorrow.
