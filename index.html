  # The Coffin Roads

The myriad gate-linked Mini-spheres are wet and low, blue and night-green with rain and grief.

Mist and monasteries. Quiet religious war.

When a man dies, he takes a last journey. The Coffin Roads await.

You belong to a Sword-Arm of the church. Why do you fight? Why do you brave the curious Gates, and the savage waste between them? 

Decide.

Whose body cools in the coffin? Who were they to you? 

We players will learn, in time.

One of you is Specialist. You have recovered Relics of watching and waiting: A sensor frond. An arquebus. 

You're missing an eye.

The Idol-Burners hunt you. Iconoclasm sweeps the realm like a bog-tide. Each town, each priest, each peasant has their allegiances.

Trust carefully. Help might be far away.
