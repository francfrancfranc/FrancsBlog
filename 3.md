### 13/04/2024 | Swyvers Session 7: The Fetch

*This is the first play report. Previous sessions were not documented.*

*Context from the preceding session: Tom The Bastard(player) met Bonnie (guest player), a Scottish warrior sent to find them. Apparently a Druid up North believes Tom to be the last remaining heir of a druidic bloodline. The crew decided to hijack a ship and go to investigate -- seeing as it would help them cool off some of the heat they've gathered with the nightwatchmen. They also had in tow a band of 6 Republicans they had met and befriended in the Middens. These Republicans hope to find comrades in the North.*

**Coffin Road**: Farflung communities bear their dead along these paths so that they will not come walking back.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpse_road

**Fetch**: Highland doppleganger, appears at night. Meant to be an omen of death. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetch_(folklore), see also Borges' Book of Imaginary Beings.

#### Prep

I had limited time to prep, admittedly entirely self-imposed. Here's what I knew beforehand:
The players were on their way to Scotland.
The Druid who originally requested Tom come up north is now dead.

Here are my session notes in their entirety.

- Arrive in Cloachocc
- Dead harbour
- Interred body of Doirin
- Follow the Coffin Road to the Settlement (Balleyaggan)
- Encounter the Fetch

**Fetch**

HD as enemy. 
Attack +2. 
Defense 0. 
Initiative 2. 

The Fetch is a being of the land. Manifestation of nature's balk at industrialisation, a revulsion so deep as to border fascination. The Fetch studies its prey, learning to become it, then kills it, takes its place, and from there infects society.

The Tiny Village of Balleyaggan

- Tiny
- Quiet
- Destitute

A small crofting community. The home of The Druid Doirin is a filthy hole under a lone tree atop a barrow. Inside is a Vision Host.

Destroyed notes suggest a frantic searching of bloodlines for a suitable heir to the druid knowledge. Almost all have been slain or sworn off the dark magics, until it comes to the bastard child of an exiled black-sheep, whose very name has been expunged.

Rumours

The local laird, Auld Fenn has died, with only illegitimate heirs. They are now leading raiding parties across the land to try and stamp each other out.
- Dulloch, industrialist
- James, highlander

I decided to portray this version of Scotland as mid-Clearances -- that is, the desolation of the highland communities at the hands of greedy feudal lords and industrialising forces. The old ways are being forgotten, the hills are barren and mean, and old things once appeased are waking up.
#### Play

With so little to go off of, I had few expectations as to how the session would progress. We started on the stolen ship, and proceeded to sail up the coast. It seemed like skill rolls and encounter tables for sailing a ship would just feel like a slog to get to the interesting bit -- Swyver Scotland -- so we just skipped it.  

The only thing I did was get the players to describe some of the strange sights they saw during the trip. This collaborative method for building up the world around the Smoke was inspired by the tellings of Daniel Boyle (swyvers additional writer) on the Swyvers discord channel. This yielded some cool stuff, like tree-villages and an island sized leviathan blowing spume on the horizon.

The players tied in at Cloacchocc, nothing more than a drystone chapel beside a barren cut in the rainsoaked rock. Bonnie, essentially their local guide, explained that this was the terminus of a Coffin Road. Following it would lead them to her village, Balleyaggan. Being a pragmatic young warrior without time for superstition, she had little more to add. 

I basically ran their three-day journey as a series of random encounter rolls. I split the days into 4 "watches". Two for the day, two for the night. The twist being that there's only one entry on the table: The Fetch. On a 1 or 2 with a 1d6, a watcher would sight it.

**Watch 1:** Hiking. Uneventful.

**Watch 2:** Hiking. Uneventful.

**Watch 3:** First night -- camping in an abandoned croft. Uneventful.

**Watch 4**: Camping. Fed the Fetcher (player) spots a silhouette on the horizon as dawn creeps in. When Fed moves, it copies him, his movements and gait. Fed calls for Bonnie, and when she shouts in alarm, it drops to all fours and scurries over the hill. The party continues on cautiously.

**Watch 5**: Hiking. Tom The Bastard mounts a hill, sees in the bowl of the valley before them a ruin with a sheep in it. The sheep turns and looks at Tom. When it moves, it is clearly not a sheep. It moves like a man bounding on all fours. It disappears into the heather.

**Watch 6**: Hiking. Moving through forest. One of the Republicans calls a halt -- someone's fallen behind. But wait -- he's actually in the front with us? Then who was that behind? When everybody else looks, the impostor is already gone.

**Watch 7**: Camping -- in a defensible ruined croft, on open ground with good visibility. Uneventful. The group are all on edge. Gord the Fuming (player) and Lizzie, leader of the Republicans, have a calming chatter.

**Watch 8**: Camping -- Gord and Lizzie finish their watch. They go inside to wake up the next two -- to see that Matty, a Republican, is missing. Cue hysteria. Party members tensely accuse each other of being doppelgangers. Fed asks Gord a pre-agreed question that only the "real" characters would know, but Gord reasons that Fed may be the doppelganger asking in order to learn the correct answer. Gord's subsequent refusal to answer causes Fed to suspect him. They eventually agree to say the answer at the same time.

This argument wakes up the rest of the party. Lizzie and the Republicans start calling out for Matty -- and get a reply. From beyond a small rise in the terrain, Matty's voice is heard assuring that everything is ok, that he's just taking a slash, etc., etc.

**Watch 9**: Standstill. The players are anxious not to leave the road -- they just want to get going, and to hell with Matty. But their republican friends won't leave him behind.

They decide on an organised search, arm-width apart, advancing slowly. They get to the top of the rise, Matty is nowhere to be seen. The voice has stopped now.

Continuing the search, they reach a stagnant lake in a peat bog, finding one of Matty's shoes along the way. Suddenly, a drowning figure can be seen in the lake, shouting for help in Matty's voice. Republicans Jane and Ben rush in to help him. The players manage to keep Lizzie and Denise from going, too. 

Jane and Ben are struggling, shouting for more help. Gord tosses a rope, but when it lands perfectly on top of them, the splashing stops completely. Jane and Ben are nowhere to be seen. The rope sinks into mud.

Wickerman (player) puts his hand into the water. His hand rests on the yielding soft face of Matty. His corpse is scratched, recently strangled, missing a shoe. With some more invesitgation it becomes clear that Matty's fingernails were removed, likely to the end of extracting personal information.

**Watch 10**: Hiking. The party decides to get the fuck out of there, assuming Ben and Jane are also dead. As the day drags on, Wickerman spots something pretending to be Ben, looking filthy and wet, standing motionless on a hillock. Wickerman calls out to it openly, saying they know it is an impostor. He suggests that they could work together to achieve mutual goals, rather than engage in conflict. 

It says, "I have your friends."

"What?"

"Come and get them?"

Wickerman forges on with his attempt at diplomacy. "Why don't we meet in the middle? I walk to you, you walk to me."

"Just you, no one else."

"Okay."

The party looks on as Wickerman steps through the heather to meet the Fetch.

They meet, and Wickerman asks it, "what do you want?"

It replies, "You," and closes its arms around him.

*This session ended up being extremely memorable, sadistic, fun. Cool thing to do with doppelgangers: Write on a piece of paper, "you are not the impostor", and hand it out to people secretly. The twist for this session was that none of the players were impostors, but handing out the cards in secret caused them to all cast suspicion on each other. Made for some great uncertain, tense RP moments. Idea stolen wholesale from Matthew Colville's campaign diaries for The Chain.*

*Having just one gradually escalating encounter for the three-day journey felt really awesome. It ran with the feeling I wanted to create of a barren, hostile, abandoned land.*
