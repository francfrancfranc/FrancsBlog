> Another excerpt from an upcoming project entitled *The Star Whaler.* This one's a bit of a tangent: a possibly unhinged dungeon-seed that may be developed into an actual thing sometime soon(?)  

To be eaten by the dragon could well be instantly fatal. It could also be an adventure in itself. A fully-realised dungeon in a dragon's dream is beyond the scope of *The Star Whaler*, but here is a sketch to get you started.

**Dungeon of The Obtunded Sabre**
Long ago, the dragon Quivern swallowed a dungeon. It drives her mad. Only the golden fire of barge-engines quiets her roiling belly.  
+ **the obtunded sabre**. Entered the past to craft itself. Gifted to the Royal Order of Geriatricians to mark their ascension to high court.  
	+ *blue-jade tulwar. +2 to dmg roll. Wielder obtunded from the fabric of spacetime. Past, present, and future selves are separated, becoming as simulacra. Set adrift in time, causally independent of each other.*    
+ **macerator kobolds**. (dragon macrophages). Gnash on anything chewable. The dungeon itself is too hard for their little teeth.  
+ **Geriatrician's stone**. Key to practicing the Order's highest mystery: extraction + distillation of age into **anti-ambrosia** (ages on touch). Its manual of operation has been fiendishly cyphered.  
	+ Several tanks of anti-ambrosia have burst, flooding rooms. The kobolds often run into it and(having a lifespan of only a few days) evaporate on touching it.  
+ **carebots.** Directive: identify the sufficiently old (relative to species' lifespan). Feed them, wash them, and put them to bed; once expired, cremate them. The wards are full of clean, cosy kobolds.
