    ### 08/04/2024 Alternate Swyvers Combat
    
    HP. Starting HP is 3d6, so between 3 and 18 with an average of 10 or 11.
    
   
    Street fighting. It should be pretty brutal. Could go either way on an even playing field. But when is it ever? Ambushes, surprise attacks, or negotiation should be preferred.
   
    I just watched Dune. Hand to hand combat should be full of feints and tricks, aiming to set up for a single killing blow.
    
    Simplicity. It’s not really a fighting game. A scrap shouldn’t last half the session.
   
    Dice. Just cubes please.
    
    Initiative
    
    Begin with surprise actions, followed by Troika chit-pull. In short: Players get two chits. GM gets chits per enemy as per stat blocks (e.g. Dog 3, Geezer 2, Elephant 1), to a max of 8. There’s an end of round chit. Pull at random. When the end of round is pulled, all chits go back in to the bag.
    
    When you pull your chit, have the option of holding onto it until another party member pulls theirs, for team moves.
    
    Dice
    
    Fight: opposed 2D6+skill. Highest wins. Loser takes the difference as damage to HP.
    
    Maneuver: Spend an action to remove the ability to retaliate. Likely to require a skill test, but if the idea is smart, consider that a successful INT test. Make the test opposed if it makes sense to do so. Once done, put your chit back in the pile. On success, the target does not oppose the next attack against them. Maneuver skills are specific. Instead of Grapple +3, you have Leg Sweep +1 and Headlock +2.
    
    NPC Maneuver: Doesn’t work the same. It doesn’t remove the opposed roll, it just inflicts (low) flat damage on success. Normal enemies shouldn’t be doing as many maneuvers. For VIPs, maneuvers do extra stuff like AoE damage or altering the combat environment. 
    
    Social combat: Rhetorical jockeying. Only usable against enemies that can communicate and can be coerced, confused, denigrated, or bargained with. Opposed 2D6+skill, loser takes the damage. Damage is taken to enemies’ Morale, players’ HP. Can’t Kill or Maim; falling to 0hp from social combat represents a crippling insult or psychologically injurious rhetoric.
    
    Range: A surprise shot, against a slow or still target, out of initiative, hits — 2d6 damage. In combat, opposed 2D6+skill. If enemy loses, they take the difference as damage. If the enemy wins, pull a random chit and then put it back— the arrows hits that person, and they take the difference as damage. 
    
    Armour
    
    Shields and armour are temp HP. It breaks. 3 levels: Ropey(1), decent(2), or mint(3). 
    
    Weapon quality is damage reduction. 3 levels: Ropey(0), decent(-1), mint(-2).

    ### 08/04/2024 The Coffin Roads
    
    The myriad gate-linked Mini-spheres are wet and low, blue and night-green with rain and grief.
    
    Mist and monasteries. Quiet religious war.   
    
    When a man dies, he takes a last journey. The Coffin Roads await.
    
    You belong to a Sword-Arm of the church. Why do you fight? Why do you brave the curious Gates, and the savage waste between them? 
    
    Decide.
    
    Whose body cools in the coffin? Who were they to you? 
    
    We players will learn, in time.
    
    One of you is Specialist. You have recovered Relics of watching and waiting: A sensor frond. An arquebus. 
    
    You're missing an eye.

    Your orbital port interfaces with the Sensor-Frond, gifting multi-spectrum sight. Interface with other Relics of the Disciples at your peril.
    
    One of you is Quartermaster. You carry the tea. You make the tea. You are heavier than the rest of them put together, body and soul.

    One of you might be Padre. You lead this Sword-Arm. You take their confessions. Ease weight of sins enacted by the Bishop’s will.

    The Idol-Burners hunt you. Iconoclasm sweeps the realm like a bog-tide. Each town, each priest, each peasant has their allegiances.
    
    Trust carefully. Help might be far away.
